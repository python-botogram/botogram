Deploy your bot
===============

Well, you've created your first bot. It works perfectly, your friends are
loving it, and you are happy about what you've done. The problem is, you
can't keep it running on your computer. You need to deploy it to a server.

This section will teach you how to do that on a Linux server, in a secure and
reliable way. It will also explain how to quickly run an instance of it,
without a full-fledged deployment. Even if this guide exists, be sure to have a
bit of experience on managing Linux servers.
