.. _changelog-0.3.1:

botogram 0.3.1
==============

*Alpha release, released on June 14th, 2016*

botogram 0.3.1 is the third alpha release of botogram. It reaches almost
feature parity with the upstream Telegram API (except for keyboards and
inlines), including the new features in the Bot API 2.0 and 2.1 updates, such
as moderating group chats or editing messages.

Performance are improved, with a faster updates fetching process, and a bug was
fixed in this release. There are also a few deprecations to keep the API clean.
All the deprecated features in this release will be removed in botogram 1.0, so
you have plenty of time to switch to the new ones.
