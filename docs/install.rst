========================
Installation of botogram
========================

botogram is available `on the Python Packages Index`_, so you can install it
really easily with the `pip`_ command-line utility. Before installing it, be
sure to have Python_ 3.4 (or a newer version), pip_, virtualenv_ and
setuptools_ installed on your system. Then, issue the following command::

   $ python3 -m pip install botogram

Perfect, botogram is now installed! Now, you can follow the
":ref:`tutorial`" chapter if you want to create a bot right now!

Living on the edge
==================

If you don't mind having some instability or bugs, and you want the latest
features not yet released, you can clone the `botogram git repository`_,
install `virtualenv`_, `invoke`_ and execute the installation from source::

   $ git clone https://github.com/pietroalbini/botogram.git
   $ cd botogram
   $ invoke install

Remember that something can change without notice, and even be removed, until
the feature is released, so don't use a non-released version in production.

About virtual environments
==========================

Installing Python packages globally isn't a good practice. A large part of the
Python community solves this problem with a tool called virtualenv_, which
creates a small, isolated Python installation for each project. This allows
you to experiment in a project without affecting other ones.

In order to create a virtual environment, first of all you need to `install
virtualenv`_. Next, you can issue the following command to create a virtual
environment in ``env/``::

   $ virtualenv -p python3 env

So, you've now a virtual environment with Python 3 in it. In order to activate
it, you can source into the terminal the ``bin/activate`` script::

   $ source env/bin/activate

Now, everything you install with pip will be confined in that environment.
This means you need to enter the virtual environment every time you want to
run the script. When you're done working in the virtual environment, you can
exit by calling the ``deactivate`` command::

   $ deactivate

.. _install-troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting
===============

You might encounter some errors while installing botogram. Here is explained how
to fix the most recurring ones:

Insufficient permissions
------------------------

On some linux systems, you usually don't have enough privileges to install
something globally. In this case, you can ask your system administrator to
execute the above command, or you can wrap the command with sudo, if you
are allowed to do so::

   $ sudo pip3 install botogram

If you installed from source, you need to use this command instead of the last
one::

   $ sudo invoke install
