====================
Obtaining an API key
====================

Before diving in the source code of the bot, you need to create the bot in
Telegram and get its API key. In order to do so, open your favourite Telegram
client and start a chat with `@botfather`_. That's a bot which will help you
to register a new bot. When you've opened the chat, type the following
command::

   /newbot

And follow the instructions it gives to you. When you've given it everything
it needs to know, it will give you an API key, like this fake one::

   123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghi

Write it down somewhere, but **be sure to keep it secret!** Everyone with your
API key can take full control of your bot, and that's not a fun thing.

If you want to learn more about creating and customizing bots, check the
:ref:`bot creation <bot-creation>` chapter of this documentation.
