Working with channels
=====================

Telegram Channels provides a way to broadcast a message to multiple users. You
can manually send messages to them with your preferred Telegram client, but
sometimes you would want to send them with a script, or from a bot.

With botogram you can easily do that, without even the need to run the bot.

.. _channels-preparation:

Preparation
===========

Before you can start working with channels, you need to create a bot which will
be able to send messages to your channel. If you haven't done that already,
check the :ref:`bot creation <bot-creation>` chapter of this documentation.

After that you need to allow your bot to send messages to your channel. Open
your favorite Telegram client, and go to the administrators' section of your
channel. From there you should add your bot, and then you're ready.

.. _channels-standalone:

Manage without a full bot
=========================

Because a bot's initialization is quite an heavy process, you can use a
lightweight API to just interact with channels. First of all you should import
botogram, and then call the :py:func:`botogram.channel` function to get a
channel object:

.. code-block:: python

   import botogram

   chan = botogram.channel("@my_channel", "YOUR_API_KEY")

You need to replace ``@my_channel`` with your channel's public name, and
``YOUR_API_KEY`` with the key you got before. Then you can use all the methods
of the :py:class:`~botogram.Chat` object with the instance you are returned.
For example, if you want to send a text message you should do:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   chan = botogram.channel("@my_channel", "YOUR_API_KEY")
   chan.send("Hello world")

.. _channels-bot:

Manage from a running bot
=========================

If you want to control a channel from your bot, you can use all the methods
which sends messages with the channel name as the user ID. For example, if you
want to forward all the messages your bot receives to the ``@my_channel``
channel, you can do something like this:

.. code-block:: python

   @bot.process_message
   def forward_messages(chat, message):
       message.forward_to("@my_channel")

If instead you want to announce to the ``@my_channel`` channel when someone
cites botogram in a chat, you can do this:

.. code-block:: python

   @bot.message_contains("botogram")
   def we_are_famous(bot, chat, message):
       user = "Someone"
       if message.sender.username is not None:
           user = message.sender.username

       bot.chat("@my_channel").send("%s mentioned botogram!" % user)
